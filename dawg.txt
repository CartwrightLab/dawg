COMMAND LINE USAGE
  dawg -[scvh?] file1 [file2...]
  -s: process files serially
  -c: process files combined together
  -u: unbuffered output
  -v: display version information
  -h: display help information
  -?: same as -h

  Dawg will read stdin if filename is "-".

FILE FORMAT
  The file format takes a series of statements in the form of
  "name = value," where "name" is alphanumeric and value can
  be a string, number, boolean, tree, or vector of values.

  string:  "[char-sequence]"
           <<EOF [several lines] EOF
  number:  [sign]digits[.digits][(e|E)[sign]digits]
  boolean: true|false
  tree:    Newick Format
  vector:  { value, value, ...}
