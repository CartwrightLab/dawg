  Dawg will read stdin if filename is "-".

FILE FORMAT
  The file format takes a series of statements in the form of
  "name = value," where "name" is alphanumeric and value can be a string,
  number, boolean, tree, or vector of values.  A single variable is
  equivalent to a vector of a single entry.

string:  "[char-sequence]"
         '[char-sequence]'
         """[multi-line char-sequence]""" (rm initial and final newlines)
         '''[multi-line char-sequence]''' (kp initial and final newlines)
number:  [sign]digits[.digits][(e|E)[sign]digits]
boolean: true|false
tree:    Newick Format
vector:  { value, value, ...}
