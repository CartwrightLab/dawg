DAWG is an application that will simulate nucleotide evolution with gaps.

See COPYING for license information.

See INSTALL for installation instructions.

EXAMPLES
  example0.fud - minimal
  example1.fud - typical usage
  example2.fud - simple indel formation
  example3.fud - robust indel formation
  example4.fud - recombination 

COMMAND LINE USAGE
  dawg -[scvh?] file1 [file2...]
  -s: process files serially
  -c: process files combined together
  -u: unbuffered output
  -v: display version information
  -h: display help information
  -?: same as -h

  Dawg will read stdin if filename is "-".

FILE FORMAT
  The file format takes a series of statements in the form of
  "name = value," where "name" is alphanumeric and value can
  be a string, number, boolean, tree, or vector of values.

  string:  "[char-sequence]"
           <<EOF [several lines] EOF
  number:  [sign]digits[.digits][(e|E)[sign]digits]
  boolean: true|false
  tree:    Newick Format
  vector:  { value, value, ...}

OPTIONS
  Name          Type            Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tree           VT  phylogeny
  TreeScale      N   coefficient to scale branch lengths by
  Sequence       VS  root sequences 
  Length         VN  length of generated root sequences
  Rates          VVN rate of evolution of each root nucleotide
  Model          S   model of evolution: GTR|JC|K2P|K3P|HKY|F81|F84|TN
  Freqs          VN  nucleotide (ACGT) frequencies 
  Params         VN  parameters for the model of evolution
  Width          N   block width for indels and recombination
  Scale          VN  block position scales
  Gamma          VN  coefficients of variance for rate heterogenity
  Alpha          VN  shape parameters
  Iota           VN  proportions of invariant sites
  GapModel       VS  models of indel formation: NB|PL|US
  Lambda         VN  rates of indel formation
  GapParams      VN  parameter for the indel model
  Reps           N   number of data sets to output
  File           S   output file 
  Format         S   output format: Fasta|Nexus|Phylip
  GapSingleChar  B   output gaps as a single character
  GapPlus        B   distinguish insertions from deletions in alignment
  LowerCase      B   output sequences in lowercase
  NexusCode      S   text or file to include between datasets in Nexus format
  Seed           VN  PRNG seed (integers)

The meaning of the Params vector is different for each substitution model.
  GTR: Substitution rates A-C, A-G, A-T, C-G, C-T, G-T
  JC:  Ignored
  K2P: Transition rate, Transversion rate
  K3P: Alpha (Transitions), Beta (A-T & G-C), Gamma (A-C & G-T)
  HKY: Transition rate, Transversion rate
  F81: Ignored
  F84: Kappa
  TN:  Alpha1 (A-G), Alpha2 (C-T), Beta (Transversions)

The meaning of the GapParams vector is different for each gap model.
  US: The distribution of gap sizes.
  NB: The number of failures (r), the probability of success (q).
  PL: The rate parameter (a), the maximum gap size.

To create a recombinant tree, you may need to specifically describe and label the
inner nodes at which the recombination events occur.  See example4.fud.

Gamma takes precidence over Alpha.

Sequence takes precidence over Length.

If NexusCode is the name of a file, the code is read from that file.
