COMMAND LINE USAGE
  dawg -[scubvh?] file1 [file2...]
  -s: process files serially [default]
  -c: process files combined together
  -u: unbuffered output
  -b: buffered output [default]
  -v: display version information
  -h: display help information
  -?: same as -h

  Dawg will read stdin if filename is "-".

FILE FORMAT
  The file format takes a series of statements in the form of "name = value,"
  where "name" is alphanumeric and value can be a string, number, boolean,
  tree, or vector of values.  A single variable is equivalent to a vector of
  a single entry.

  string:  "[char-sequence]"
           <<EOF [several lines] EOF
  number:  [sign]digits[.digits][(e|E)[sign]digits]
  boolean: true|false
  tree:    Newick Format
  vector:  { value, value, ...}

DEFAULTS

  TreeScale = 1.0
  Length = 100
  Model = "JC"
  Freqs = {0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25}
  Params = {1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0}
  Width = 1
  Scale = 1.0
  Gamma = 0.0
  Iota =  0.0
  GapModel = "US"
  GapParams = 1.0
  Reps = 1
  Format = "Fasta"
  GapSingleChar = false
  GapPlus = false
  LowerCase = false
  Translate = false

NOTES

The meaning of the "Params" vector is different for each substitution model.
  GTR: Substitution rates A-C, A-G, A-T, C-G, C-T, G-T
  JC:  Ignored
  K2P: Transition rate, Transversion rate
  K3P: Alpha (Transitions), Beta (A-T & G-C), Gamma (A-C & G-T)
  HKY: Transition rate, Transversion rate
  F81: Ignored
  F84: Kappa
  TN:  Alpha1 (A-G), Alpha2 (C-T), Beta (Transversions)

Parameter "Freqs" is ignored by the models "JC", "K2P", and "K3P".

If "Lambda" is a single value, then it specifies the rate of indel formation, e.g.
"Lambda = 0.1" is the same as "Lambda = {0.05, 0.05}".  The first parameter is the
insertion rate and the second parameter is the deletion rate.

The first parameter of "GapModel" specifies the distribution model of insertion sizes.
The second parameter specifies the distribution model of deletion sizes.  If only one
parameter is given it is the model for both insertions and deletions.

The first parameter of "GapParams" is a vector specifying the parameters for the
gap model of insertions.  Likewise the second parameter is a vector specifying the
parameters for the gap model of deletions.  If "GapParams" is not a vector of vectors,
then it specifies the vector of parameters for both insertions and deletions.

The meaning of the GapParams vector is different for each gap model.
  US: The distribution of gap sizes.
  NB: The number of failures (r), the probability of success (q).
  PL: The rate parameter (a), the maximum gap size.

To create a recombinant tree, you may need to specifically describe and label the
inner nodes at which the recombination events occur.  See example4.dawg.

Gamma takes precidence over Alpha.

Sequence takes precidence over Length.

If NexusCode is the name of a file, the code is read from that file.

The following vector parameters have a size of "Width": "Scale", "Alpha", "Gamma",
and "Iota".  If their size is less than width then the first value in the vector
will be used to fill in the rest of the values, e.g. "Scale = 1.0" is the same as
"Scale = {1.0,1.0,1.0}" when "Width = 3".
