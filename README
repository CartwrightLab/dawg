COMMAND LINE USAGE
  dawg -[scvh?] file1 [file2...]
  -s: process files serially
  -c: process files combined together
  -u: unbuffered output
  -v: display version information
  -h: display help information
  -?: same as -h

FILE FORMAT
  The file format takes a series of statements in the form of
  "name = value," where "name" is alphanumeric and value can
  be a string, number, boolean, tree, or vector of values.

  string:  "[char-sequence]"
           <<EOF [several lines] EOF
  number:  [sign]digits[.digits][(e|E)[sign]digits]
  boolean: true|false
  tree:    Newick Format
  vector:  { value, value, ...}

OPTIONS
  Name          Type            Description
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Tree           VT  phylogeny
  Scale          N   coefficient to scale branch lengths by
  Sequence       VS  root sequences 
  Length         VN  length of generated root sequences
  Rates          VVN rate of evolution of each root nucleotide
  Model          S   model of evolution: GTR|JC|K2P|K3P|HKY|F81|F84|TN
  Freqs          VD  nucleotide (ACGT) frequencies 
  Params         VN  parameters for the model of evolution
  Gamma          N   coefficient of variance for rate heterogenity
  Alpha          N   shape parameter
  Iota           N   proportion of invariant sites
  GapModel       VS  models of indel formation: NB|User
  Lambda         VN  rates of indel formation
  GapParams      VN  parameter for the indel model
  Frame          N   size of frame to restrict indels to
  Reps           N   number of data sets to output
  File           S   output file 
  Format         S   output format: Fasta|Nexus|Phylip
  GapSingleChar  B   output gaps as a single character
  GapPlus        B   distinguish insertions from deletions
  NexusBlock     S   text to include between datasets in Nexus format
  NexusBlockFile S   file to read the Nexus block from
  Seed           VN  PRNG seed

The meaning of the Params vector is different for each substitution model.
  GTR: Substitution rates A-C, A-G, A-T, C-G, C-T, G-T
  JC:  Ignored
  K2P: Transition rate, Transversion rate
  K3P: Alpha (Transitions), Beta (A-T & G-C), Gamma (A-C & G-T)
  HKY: Transition rate, Transversion rate
  F81: Ignored
  F84: Kappa
  TN:  Alpha1 (A-G), Alpha2 (C-T), Beta (Transversions)

The meaning of the GapParams vector is different for each gap model.
  User: The distribution of gap sizes.
  NB:   The number of failures (r), the probability of success (q).

To create a recombinant tree, you may need to specifically describe and label the
inner nodes at which the recombination events occur.  See example2.fud.
